# Myguo-Documentation


Welcome to the Myguo Documentation repository. This repository is dedicated to providing comprehensive documentation on the Myguo platform. It outlines our vision, architecture, planned features, and our roadmap. Our goal is to help early adopters, developers, and partners understand the platform, experiment with mock data, and contribute ideas as we build this project together.

**Please Note:** All the documentation here is a work in progress. The content, plans, and technical details are evolving, and we appreciate your feedback and contributions.

## Vision

Myguo is built to be the AI research search engine for decentralized finance. Our mission is to simplify the complex world of DeFi by aggregating data from trusted sources and presenting actionable insights through a natural, conversational interface. We aim to empower both newcomers and seasoned investors with the tools they need to make informed decisions.

## Architecture

### Overview

Myguo's architecture is divided into several key components:

- **Core Backend:**  
  This is where data aggregation, natural language processing, and proprietary analytics live. It collects and processes data from multiple sources such as Cookie, Kaito, Nansen, Messari, Aixbt, CoinGecko, Dexscreener, and Bubblemaps.

- **Dashboard:**  
  A user-facing web application that presents real-time market intelligence and allows users to interact with the platform using natural language commands. It connects securely to the backend services.

- **Public API:**  
  A set of endpoints that expose non-sensitive data for third-party integrations. This API is designed to allow external developers to build on top of Myguo without accessing our proprietary logic.

- **Developer SDK:**  
  Wrapper libraries in TypeScript and Python to help developers easily integrate with our public API.

- **Conversational Interface:**  
  A chat and voice-based interface for executing natural language commands.

### Future Phases
- **Enhanced Analytics:**  
  Advanced, personalized insights based on user portfolio and predictive market data.
  
- **Cross-Chain Functionality:**  
  Support for multi-chain interactions to broaden the scope of DeFi operations.
  
- **Community Insights:**  
  A platform for users to share research, strategies, and predictions.

   Focus on core functionalities such as data aggregation, user onboarding, and the conversational interface.
   
2. **Feature Enhancement:**  
   Expand our market intelligence capabilities, refine our NLP engine, and introduce advanced analytics.
   
3. **Ecosystem Growth:**  
   Launch the public API and developer SDK, and open channels for community contributions and third-party integrations.

4. **Enterprise & Global Expansion:**  
   Scale up our infrastructure, add multi-chain support, and forge strategic partnerships in the DeFi ecosystem.
